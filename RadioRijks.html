        <h3>What is Radio Rijks?</h3>
        <p>
            Radio Rijks is a small radio studio at my school, RSG t'Rijks. I've been at this radio for the past 1 and a half years.
            I enjoy the abilities that this studio gives me, with playing music, but also coding.
        </p>
        <h3>The kinds of music</h3>
        <p>
            Usually I play songs from the 2010-2018 years, because that is the kind of music that I enjoy, but we also play some newer songs.
        </p>
        <h3>Coding opportunities</h3>
        <p>
            I used a few libraries from github and combined them for what we needed.
            <h5>SongRec</h5>
            I got a library from github and set it up to automatically get the current song playing every 15 seconds, and then use that data
            for the Lightbar and LastFM.
            <h5>Lightbar</h5>
            The song data would be sendt to a led bar sitting at the window, so people can see the name and artist of the artist of the song.
            The led board is controlled via socket, by a program I partially found of github, and partially edited by reading the ethernet data
            of the official software (sigma 3000 - really old). I can now send messages, update the time, and custom color things to the Lightbar.
            <h5>LastFM</h5>
            LastFM is a website on which you can track your played songs. We set all played songs to there, so that the website (which my friend is making)
            can use the data from there to have a little player on the website, with the album cover included.
        </p>
        <br>
        <h5>Discord Bot</h5>
        <p>
            For some more tasks we wanted (semi) automated, I made a discord bot.
            Because I used python for this, I wanted multithreading so the program would work while a command is running.
            I finally found out how to do this
            <br><code>"asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe(Command, loop=main_loop)"</code><br>
            This allows me to run any command that is async, but still in the main_loop.
            I have multiple commands implemented, Ill List some of them:
            <ul>
                <li>Help - For showing all commands</li>
                <li>lightbar - for sending custom messages to the lightbar</li>
                <li>image - automake an image with a specific overlay (new music friday or song of the mont)</li>
                <li>insta - to post that image to instagram</li>
                <li>confirm - to confirm or stop something select either the check or the cross emoji</li>
            </ul>
            The command image takes in the song name and the artist name (and if wanted an instagram tag), automatically gets the cover image, and puts the overlay (with text) on it
            it then asks it to post in on instagram, automatically done with InstagrAPI.
