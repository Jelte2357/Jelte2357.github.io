        <h1>Hello, im Jelte2357 - This is my experience with Github</h1>
        I've used it for quite some time!
        <hr class="horizonal-line">
        <h3>Since when have I had github?</h3>
        <p>
            I joined github on June 18th - 2021.
        </p>
        <p>
            Though, I only really started using it in 2023. <br>
            I was working on a project, wanting to port The Binding Of Isaac Afterbirth to the 3DS - Which only has Rebirth. Trying to use a tool named Patchrom, it kept giving errors.
            This was because the python program was made using python 2, and I was running python 3.
            I fixed the problems in the code, and made a pull request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not knowing of github desktop, I used Git Bash for committing. It was a lot of work that was absolutely not needed.
        </p>


        <h3>What have I used Github for?</h3>
        <p>
            I have used Github for multiple projects of mine, some of which were for Radio Rijks and Advent of Code.
            <br>- Ill mention those on their respective pages.
            <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            One program I am particularly proud of is AutoRequirements. I made a python program that automatically generates a requirements.txt in a folder.
            This was done without using any external libraries, I wanted it to be possible by just copy pasting the code in a file if you wanted to.
            I made this as the most popular auto-generator for requirements.txt was not working to my liking! The package is on PyPi, and it can be run using either AutoRequirements and/or AutoReqs.
        </p>


        <h3>Why do I use Github?</h3>
        <p>
            Simple, useability and safety. My code will be backed up in the cloud, people can work together with me on projects, and I have a good overview of issues and other things.
            Github makes my life coding a lot easier
